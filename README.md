This project aims to make a physical representation of SpaceAPI data, on a map.

The project originally started at the [TechInc](https://techinc.nl/) hackerspace, then moved to [LAG](https://laglab.org/) and then finally recently started to take shape during a get-together at [NURDspace](https://nurdspace.nl/).

Some day it may actually be finished.

Eventually the idea is that the whole thing is a map, made out of PCBs, the size of a really big poster and with a nice interface on the side.
